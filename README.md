# Home Credit Default Risk Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their home credit loan. The model leverages various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to assess credit risk based on the Home Credit Default Risk dataset from Kaggle.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can assess the probability of a loan applicant defaulting on a home credit loan. By analyzing various features in the dataset, the model aims to provide financial institutions with a reliable tool for evaluating loan applications and managing associated risks.

## Datasets

This project uses the **Home Credit Default Risk** dataset, available on **Kaggle**:

## Models Used

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Various features are created to enhance the model's performance and capture more complex patterns in the data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Different hyperparameters are optimized for each model to achieve the best possible performance.
